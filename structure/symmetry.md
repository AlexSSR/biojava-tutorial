Protein Symmetry using BioJava
================================================================

BioJava can be used to detect, analyze, and visualize **symmetry** and 
**pseudo-symmetry** in the quaternary (biological assembly) and tertiary 
(internal) structural levels.

## Quaternary Symmetry

### Global Symmetry


### Local Symmetry


### Pseudo-Symmetry


## Internal Symmetry

**Internal symmetry** refers to the symmetry present in a single chain, that is, 
the tertiary structure. The algorithm implemented in biojava to detect internal 
symmetry is called **CE-Symm**.
