Detection of Protein Symmetry  and Pseudo-symmetry using BioJava
================================================================

This chapter is still under construction. See the [protein symmetry](https://github.com/rcsb/symmetry) project for more information for now.

BioJava can be used to
 - Detect, analyze, and visualize **protein symmetry**
 - Detect symmetry in **biological assemblies**
